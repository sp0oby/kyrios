  "q": "What happens when I deposit?",
  "a": "When you deposit, your METIS gets locked into the Kyrios Finance smart contract and rewards you with 8% daily return every day."
},
{
  "q": "Can I take my initial METIS back?",
  "a": "Over Time! Kyrios is not bought, Kyrios is mined therefore they can't be sold. Once Kyrios is mined they work for you indefinitely, providing you with an unlimited amount of METIS at a starting rate of 8% daily."
},
{
  "q": "How much are my fees?",
  "a": "There is a small 5% dev fee in order to pay for marketing costs and developing the Kyrios Finance ecosystem"
},
{
  "q": "When is the best time to deposit?",
  "a": "Always! No matter when you hire miners, you will begin with a return rate of 8% daily."
},
{
  "q": "How often should I compound?",
  "a": "We recommend that you compound at least once per day but you are free to do so as often as you wish."
},
{
  "q": "How is Kyrios Finance sustainable?",
  "a": "Kyrios Finance is sustained by continued community support, just as every other crypto coin, token or project. The difference is that since there is no token, there is no price to dump. As long as Kyrios is mined in the contract, there will be rewards!"
},
{
  "q": "How to use Kyrios Finance on my phone?",
  "a": "You can either use an app with a dapp browser and choose the Metamask/Injected option or simply use any browser that you want and choose WalletConnect to connect to your wallet's app on your phone."
},
{
  "q": "Is it better to compound or to collect?",
  "a": "By design, compounding will be more profitable than collecting in the long-term. The best strategy is to coumpound for six days, collect on the seventh day."
},
{
  "q": "How do referrals work?",
  "a": "Once your Metamask wallet is connected to the Kyrios Finance website, you will notice your referral address appear at the bottom of the page. When a new user hires miners after clicking your personal referral link, the contract will send a METIS value equal to 12% instantly to your Kyrios stack. Be smart, use it to compound and build yourself a stream of income."

{
  "q": "When did Kyrios Finance launch?",
